# Foglet BBS

Foglet is an SSH-first bulletin board system built with Elixir, Phoenix,
Postgres, and a terminal UI served over SSH. Accounts, boards, threads, posts,
oneliners, subscriptions, moderation, and sysop workflows all live in the
terminal experience.

Phoenix is operational infrastructure for the endpoint, PubSub, telemetry,
LiveDashboard, mail delivery plumbing, and future structured clients. 

## Requirements

- Elixir `~> 1.17` and a matching Erlang/OTP release
- PostgreSQL (any currently supported major version)
- An SSH client for connecting to the running BBS

## Quick Start

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-remote-url> foglet_bbs
cd foglet_bbs
```

Then choose the database you want Mix to use. If you already have a local
Postgres that matches `config/dev.exs`, run:

```bash
mix setup
```

To use the included Docker-backed Postgres instead of an existing local
database, start it first:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
mix setup
```

If host port `5432` is already in use, set `POSTGRES_PORT` for Compose and
`DATABASE_URL` for Mix, for example:

```bash
POSTGRES_PORT=55432 docker compose up -d postgres
DATABASE_URL=ecto://postgres:postgres@localhost:55432/foglet_bbs_dev mix setup
```

`mix setup` runs `deps.get`, `ecto.create`, `ecto.migrate`, `run priv/repo/seeds.exs`,
and configures the project's git hooks path.

Start the application:

```bash
mix phx.server
```

Phoenix and the SSH daemon both come up under the OTP supervision tree. The
default SSH port is `2222` (override with the `FOGLET_SSH_PORT` environment
variable).

## Connecting

Connect with any standard SSH client:

```bash
ssh USERNAME@localhost -p 2222
```

Foglet supports both **SSH key** and **password** authentication. Users may
register and add SSH keys through the in-TUI account workflows. Once a key is
registered, subsequent sessions can authenticate without a password.

Only one active session per user is allowed; opening a second session will
promote the new connection and close the older one.

## Operator Notes

### Delivery Modes

Foglet stores the active delivery mode in runtime configuration as
`delivery_mode`.

**Email mode** (`delivery_mode=email`): registration verification, password
reset, and account-status notices may be delivered through the configured
mail adapter. SMTP host, port, username, password, and adapter settings
belong in environment/runtime config (`config/runtime.exs` or deployment
environment variables) and **not** in DB-backed runtime config.

**no-email mode** (`delivery_mode=no_email`): no outbound email is sent.
Operators retrieve reset tokens or verification codes through break-glass
Mix tasks and communicate them out-of-band.

### Break-Glass Mix Tasks

Run these from the application release or source checkout against the same
database and runtime environment as the running node:

```bash
mix foglet.user.reset_password HANDLE
mix foglet.user.verification_code HANDLE
mix foglet.user.status HANDLE --actor SYSOP --status active
mix foglet.board_subscriptions list --user HANDLE
```

- `foglet.user.reset_password HANDLE` — generates a raw reset token for
  operator-assisted SSH reset handling. Does not send email and does not
  produce a browser reset URL.
- `foglet.user.verification_code HANDLE` — generates a verification code for
  no-email operation. In email mode, prefer the normal Login or Verify
  resend flow.
- `foglet.user.status HANDLE --actor SYSOP --status STATUS` — changes user
  status through the same Accounts authorization boundary as TUI workflows.
  Valid statuses are `active`, `rejected`, and `suspended`.
- `foglet.board_subscriptions list --user HANDLE` — lists a user's board
  subscription directory. Also supports `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` actions
  with `--board BOARD_SLUG`. Required-subscription and archived-board rules
  still route through `Foglet.Boards`.

Additional operator tasks live in `lib/mix/tasks/`, including
`foglet.user.create`, `foglet.user.promote`, and `foglet.doctor`.

## Launch Caveats

The following are **not** v1.2 pre-alpha capabilities. Foglet should not be
operated as though they exist yet:

- No end-user web UI. Browser-facing Phoenix surfaces are operational
  infrastructure only.
- No browser admin console.
- No webhook notifications.
- No email digests.
- No delivery retry queues or outbound delivery logs.
- No full case-management moderation.

## Repository Layout

- `lib/foglet_bbs/` — `Foglet.*` domain code (Accounts, Boards, Threads, Posts,
  Sessions, SSH, TUI, Authorization, Config) plus `FogletBbs.*` Phoenix
  infrastructure (Application, Repo, Mailer, etc.). Both namespaces coexist in
  this directory; the boundary is by module name, not by path.
- `lib/foglet_bbs_web/` — `FogletBbsWeb.*` Phoenix endpoint, telemetry,
  LiveDashboard.
- `lib/mix/tasks/` — operator break-glass Mix tasks.
- `docs/` — project documentation. See
  [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
  [`docs/DATA_MODEL.md`](docs/DATA_MODEL.md).
- `docs/raxol/` — **vendored** Raxol library documentation. These are
  upstream library docs, not Foglet-specific content.
- `vendor/raxol/` — vendored Raxol TUI library source.

## Development

The project finish line is:

```bash
mix precommit
```

`precommit` runs `compile --warnings-as-errors`, `deps.unlock --unused`,
`format`, `credo --strict`, `sobelow --exit Low`, and `dialyzer`.

Run the test suite with:

```bash
mix test
```

`mix test` ensures the test database is created and migrated, seeds runtime
config, and then runs the suite.

For deeper context on namespaces, persistence invariants, authorization
scopes, SSH/TUI ownership, and workflow conventions, read
[`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) before non-trivial changes.
