# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs for the Raxol project. Each one captures a single architectural decision: why it was made, not just what was decided.

## ADR Index

## Template

New ADRs should follow this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYYY]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

### Positive
- List of positive consequences

### Negative
- List of negative consequences

### Mitigation
How do we mitigate the negative consequences?

## Validation
How do we validate that this decision was correct?

## References
Links to related documentation, discussions, or resources.
```

## Why ADRs?

They preserve context for why decisions were made, help new contributors understand the architecture, and give us something concrete to revisit when circumstances change.

## Adding a New ADR

1. Create a new file using the template above
2. Number it sequentially (0012, 0013, etc.)
3. Start with status "Proposed"
4. Get review, then update to "Accepted"
5. Update the index table in this file
